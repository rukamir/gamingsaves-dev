The selection of progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will help him in his quest.

One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\'s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\nThe hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero’s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets.\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there’s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. Some traps can be avoided only if time moves slower than usual, thanks to yet another special ability. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself!\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.','Teen','2018-06-27 02:00:00','2019-08-21 23:25:37'),('70010000011655','Pumped BMX Pro','Nintendo Switch',5.99,14.99,60,'https://nintendo.com/games/detail/pumped-bmx-pro-switch','https://nintendo.com/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/p/pumped-bmx-pro-switch/Switch_PumpedBMXPro_box_eShop.png','a','nintendo.com','Pumped BMX Pro puts you back on the seat for another high adrenaline, \n      fast-paced trickathon where chaining massive combos could put you at the \n      number one spot on the global leaderboards.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Pump your way through 60 levels of ever increasing difficulty, making \n      sure you&#8217;re racking up those platinum medals by completing Trick \n      Challenges along the way.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Choose from 15 riders with predesigned bikes, or get creative and design \n      your own in the easy to use bike designer.\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Pumped BMX Pro features;\n    \n    \n      - 15 characters, each with their own spectacular bike!\n    \n    \n      - 40+ radical tricks, from outrageous spins to insane grinds!\n    \n    \n      - Over 200 challenges, each harder than the last!\n    \n    \n      - 60 beautifully designed levels, from high top mountains to swampy \n      depths!\n    \n    \n      - Ragdoll physics, just in case you miss the ramp!','Everyone','2019-02-06 18:00:00','2019-08-21 23:25:37'),('70010000011657','EXORDER','Nintendo Switch',1.29,12.99,90,'https://nintendo.com/games/detail/exorder-switch','https://nintendo.com/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/e/exorder-switch/Switch_EXORDER_box_eShop.png','a','nintendo.com','A fantasy turn-based strategy game, fight for Cerulean and claim the crown as her rightful heir!\nEnjoy hours of our single player campaign and battle your friends with cross platform multiplayer.\nExpand your skills as a commander with the challenge mode.\n&nbsp;\nFEATURES:\n- 12 fantasy missions in single player campaign.\n- 8 intense challenge maps.\n- Cross platform global online multiplayer.\n- 10+ unit types with unique skills.\n&nbsp;\nABOUT THE GAME:\nThe kingdom of Cerulean needs a new ruler!
